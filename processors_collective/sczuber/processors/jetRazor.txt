need to input TObjArray of 
TLorentzVector to setPartList

processEvent:
    loop through particles:
        create the list _parp of particle momentum's for either ded, dab, tru

    need to find two jets based on _parp
    
    
    
    
    
findParDetectability:
    finds the detectability of the particle
    returns 0,1 or 2
    

better to keep JetFinder in own file.
